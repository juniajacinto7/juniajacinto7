# 💬 Hey! I'm June,
Throughout my career and educational pursuits, I have acquired many skills geared towards engineering and all things software development. As a full stack engineer, I have studied and become well-versed in Mobile Development📱 (iOS & Android), JavaScript, C++, Python, and acquired many other developmental skills. 🦾🦾

In the past I have received certifications coding bootcamps 🥾 for having worked in iOS mobile app development focusing on the design and implementation of RESTful APis.🤳🏼 These resources have allowed me to gain a greater range as a developer and to maintain a competitive upper hand in both my educational and professional career. As a developer, I have continued to cultivate a love♥️ for learning and perfecting my craft. 

I have overseen operations from product design to product development. As a software engineer, I’ve had a vast experience with both front-end development and back-end development taking on any and all sectors of the field. Leadership roles such as UI/UX and Front-End Lead to a team, during my time at The Fresno Institute of Neuroscience🧠, has given me hands on experience on how to lead a project's goals to fulfillment.✔️
